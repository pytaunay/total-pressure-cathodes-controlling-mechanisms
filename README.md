### Description
Set of files to re-create numerical results published in the following article:

* P.-Y. C. R. Taunay, C. J. Wordingham, E. Y. Choueiri, 
"Total pressure in thermionic orificed hollow cathodes: controlling mechanisms and their 
relative importance," 
Journal of Applied Physics, 2021

#### Numerical results

#### Experimental data
The experimental data we used are available in the [cathode-database repository](https://github.com/eppdyl/cathode-database) 
(DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3956853). A copy of the cathode database is available in the HDF5 file format
under a CC-BY-4.0 license.
